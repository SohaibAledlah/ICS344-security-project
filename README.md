# ICS344-security-project
This repo contains the code used in 344 project for Team 7.
Mainly the code is a python code that is used in the third task of the project (custom script).
The python code automates the brute-force attack on the service as well as the honeypot.
Tow versions of the python code are provided. They are similar, the difference is that the python script
that targets the service includes establishing a session with the service (needed by the service).

Also, the .sh file is a code for the task in Phase4 (the bonus phase), it monitors the logs, generates alerts, and blocks IP adresses trying to brute-force.

Project commands cannot be shared as a code, they are used in the linux VMs, and so they are mentioned
in details in the project report.
